    <li>Key word searching through existing online transcripts.</li>
    <li>Collaborative indexing of names and places in each entry.</li>

<tr><td><p>Current Features</p>
    <ul><li>WYAS link for each day's journal page and/or travel note, journal index </li><li>Intuitive navigation to full entry transcipts by #AnneListerCodeBreakers that are already made online. (I mean, the pages are running out fast, but how long it would take WYAS to check? Highly unpredictable! Let's put what we have now into good use)</li></ul>
</td>
    <td><p>Features in plan</p><ul><li>Indexing reference trackers of PwP and beyond, so as to: (a) indicate references that are mentioned more than once (b) show current progress and avoid repetitive work</li><li>Interact with google map using location data (trace AL's movement of each day!)</li><li>Find a way to make annotating possible? Wonder if Anne Lister Society or WYAS already have something in mind? Perhaps I wouldn't have to pother!</li><li>Timeline view of days/months scale events</li></ul>

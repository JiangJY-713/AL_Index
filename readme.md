## Indexing Anne Lister's Journal
As some [#AnneListerCodeBreakers](https://wyascatablogue.wordpress.com/exhibitions/anne-lister/anne-lister-diary-transcription-project/) might have noticed (well, at least myself), judging from the pages sent by WYAS recently,  we are wrapping up the first stage of transcribing. It is hard to predict how long the remaining checking would take, but if with the same speed as last year, could be years.   
Meanwhile, about 30% of the entries have already been posted at various platforms, and a [Transcription Blog List](https://www.packedwithpotential.org/resources/anne-lister-diary-transcripts) has been created by [PackedwithPotential](https://www.packedwithpotential.org/home). Yet still, there is inconvenience: the batches each transcriber received are well scattered, with one glance one can hardly know if a specific entry has been posted, or generally which period has been mostly available.  
Based on [js year calendar](https://github.com/year-calendar/js-year-calendar) created by Paul David-Sivelle, I compiled the transcripts links in a calendar, which is at present the best form I can think of. Also its potential won't be limited to this. For example, as much as we love spreadsheets, indicating the multiple mentions of a book/person/place etc. in the journal is still a problem. I feel it would be possible for this to interact with PwP trackers, so as to increase readability and avoid repetitive work without sacrificing the easiness of editing.


### Visit the Page 
Available transcripts can be found [here](https://jiangjy-713.github.io/AL_Index/). An entry is included only if it is fully transcribed and publicly accessible.  

### Notes
- Travel notes transcripts haven't been included. I still need to work on their seperating from the common journals visually.
- You may notice WYAS references are left blank. As it being a time-consuming work, and with a [WYAS Date Finder](https://elizaleftus.com/) available, this is not considered a priority for now. Sorry for the trouble.
- About 95% of the transcripts have been registered. Among rest there are cases when they overlap with others, or when there are extra issues need to be addressed, but I will include all the bloggers' work by and by. WYAS online transcripts are not included either.
- Currently the data (`data/data.json`) will be maintained by myself, probably until I figured out server-side programming. Though I have programming experience with MATLAB, I only started to learn web development not so long ago, for this purpose, obviously. 
- But most likely, I can't implement all my ideas alone. I have included the source code on the above for anyone interested. I am also eager to hear your thoughts! You can contact me via Github ,[Twitter](https://twitter.com/water_in_forest), or [this form](https://forms.gle/Ab1GXBibJraTtMzZ7).
